  "body": "### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\n\r\n#### Instructions\r\n\r\n1. An Android application capable on running on Android 4.1 and greater, featuring a full-screen, interactive map, using the Mapbox API/SDK (gray area in mockup below represents where the map should appear)\r\n2. Plot at least 10 pins on the map in the Greater Grand Rapids, Michigan area using a custom marker (create and load your own example data using a JSON file and see attached ZIP file of assets for the custom marker)\r\n3. When a pin is tapped, display the name of the pin in a tooltip (define the names of each pin in your JSON file of example data)\r\n4. Include a blue button with a white icon in the lower-right corner of the screen to represent creating a new pin (the button doesn't have to actually work, but bonus points if it does!)\r\n5. Include a white button with a gray icon above the blue button which zooms in and pans to the user's current location when tapped\r\n6. The user's current location should be represented on the map at all times by a blue dot\r\n7. A white crosshair should be displayed in the center of the screen at all times\r\n8. Include non-functioning search and layer visibility icons on the top right of the view (bonus points if you make the layer icon switch between two or more Mapbox Map Styles and/or if you add the ability to search using the Google Places API)\r\n9. Match the design mockup below to the best of your ability (ignore the bottom tab navigation)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n 2016, Pravin Kandala (@pravinkandala).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
